         <p>
             "Agni" is the vedic God of fire.It is a symbol of light and darkness, destruction and purification, beginnings<br>
             and endings, sacrifice and knowledge.Fire ignites passion. Passion demands change through purification ,<br>
             and destruction. In creating we destroy and in destroying we create.We create to destroy and we destroy to <br>create
             In this work , the dancers using Lobo's Prana paint technique, take the audience on a journey of <br>
             "Agni" as they seek the end. A journey that needs to be experienced more than  seen, felt more than understood.<br>

            to nothingness-a love story that just is and always was.<br><br>
            In this work, the dancers, using Ashley lobo's prana paint technique,journey to themselves to<br>
